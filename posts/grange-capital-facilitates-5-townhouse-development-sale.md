Grange Capital sourced a purchaser for a developer who wished to exit a site in Doncaster with plans and permits for 5 townhouses. The developer had the site on the market with a major agent for 6 months with no sale. Grange Capital leveraged its substantial network of active developers and found a buyer within 2 weeks of the start of the engagement.
