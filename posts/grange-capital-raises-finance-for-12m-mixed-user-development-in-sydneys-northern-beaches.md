Grange Capital raises funds for a senior secured loan to Dobroyd Developments’ $12m boutique mixed-used development, taking only 17 days from the loan request to settlement. The Heights consists of luxuriously appointed apartments and retail tenancies designed by Benson McCormack Architects and situated in the harbour-side suburb of Balgowlah Heights.
